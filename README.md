# Strangelet
editor written in golang largely adapted from micro.
Goals include command-line, cross platform, and extensible.

Specific code editor features intended include:
Code Folding
Go to Definition
File Browser
Syntax Highlighting
Auto Completion
Tabs
Single Instance (via flag)
and more

This editor is built as a learning process just as much as it is built out of desire for a more feature rich version of micro.
